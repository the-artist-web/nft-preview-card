It typically includes an image or video of the NFT, its title, a brief description, and key details such as the creator's name, current bid or price, and a call-to-action button like "View More" or "Buy Now". These cards provide a visually appealing way to present NFTs in marketplaces, galleries, or portfolios. => was created using languages HTML CSS</p>
